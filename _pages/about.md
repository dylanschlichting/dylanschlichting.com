I am a third year PhD student in the [Oceanography](https://ocean.tamu.edu/) Department at Texas A&M University interested in the kinematics and dynamics of estuarine and coastal ocean circulation. I use a combination of numerical simulations with pen and paper analysis to study salt mixing in the northern Gulf of Mexico.

I received my B.S. in civil engineering and minor in mathematics from the University of Maine in December 2019. As an undergraduate, I was an NSF REU scholar here at TAMU with Dr. [Rob Hetland](https://ocean.tamu.edu/people/profiles/faculty/hetlandrobert.html) and worked on a number of coastal engineering projects at UMaine with Dr. [Kimberly Huguenard](https://civil.umaine.edu/faculty/kimberly-huguenard/). We have a paper discussing the Sensing Storm Surge project, which established a citizen science program to monitor storm surge in several Maine estuaries and rivers. Check out the link below for more information!

My graduate research with Dr. Hetland focuses on quantifying numerical mixing in a regional model of the Texas Louisiana continental shelf (TXLA). Numerical mixing is a type of artificial mixing that results from solving the tracer and momentum equations on a grid and can introduce a host of problems that make numerical models get the details of interesting oceanographic features like eddies or fronts wrong. If we can understand how big numerical mixing is and why it is generated, we can make models more accurate.

I am also developing an analysis framework called total exchange flow (TEF) to look at mixing processes in the Gulf of Mexico. TEF was developed by Parker MacCready (2011, JPO) to look at estuarine circulation and sues salinity coordinates (weighted histograms) to describe the dynamics compared to Cartesian coordinates. This is useful because salinity often governs the density structure of estuaries and buoyancy driven flows, revealing insight about the flow's dynamics that Cartesian coordinates do not. We are also investigating how TEF may be used to quantify the net effects of submesoscale (small scale) processes as part of the NSF [SUNRISE](https://sunrise-nsf.github.io/) project.
