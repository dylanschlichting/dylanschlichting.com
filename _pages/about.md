I am a PhD candidate in the [Oceanography](https://ocean.tamu.edu/) Department at Texas A&M University. I use a combination of numerical simulations with pen and paper analysis to study spurious (i.e., numerically-induced) salt mixing over the Texas-Louisiana continental shelf in the northern Gulf of Mexico. More broadly, I am interested in understanding the larger-scale impacts of submesoscale (small-scale) processes in the upper ocean.

I received my B.S. in civil engineering and minor in mathematics from the University of Maine in December 2019. As an undergraduate, I was an NSF REU scholar here at TAMU with Dr. [Rob Hetland](https://ocean.tamu.edu/people/profiles/faculty/hetlandrobert.html) and worked on a number of coastal engineering projects at UMaine with Dr. [Kimberly Huguenard](https://civil.umaine.edu/faculty/kimberly-huguenard/). We have a paper in *Ocean and Coastal Management* discussing the Sensing Storm Surge project, which established a citizen science program to monitor storm surge in several Maine estuaries and rivers. Click [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105802) for more information.

My graduate research with Dr. Hetland focuses on quantifying numerical mixing in a regional model of the Texas Louisiana continental shelf (TXLA). Numerical models are powerful tools for studying ocean mixing, however they are prone to numerical issues because they represent physical processes with discrete approximations. Numerical mixing is one such error; the process by which the discretized advection (i.e., transport) of ocean tracers results in spurious mixing. Numerical mixing can introduce biases in the model and cause it to drift away from reality. We have a forthcoming paper that analyzes numerical mixing in the TXLA model in the *Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems*.

With my background in coastal engineering, I am also interested in estuarine dynamics. We have a new in *Journal of Physical Oceanography* that focuses on developing simple approximations to estuarine mixing using the idea of mixing pathways, which is the mixing a water mass experiences during its flow pathway. For the case of a classical estuary, mixing is caused by the input of freshwater from the river and the exchange flow that happens at the estuary mouth.
