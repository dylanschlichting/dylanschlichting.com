I am a second year PhD student in the [Oceanography](https://ocean.tamu.edu/) Department at Texas A&M University. I received my B.S. in civil engineering and minor in mathematics from the University of Maine in December 2019. I use numerical modeling to study coastal ocean circulation in the Gulf of Mexico as part of the [Physical Oceanography Numerical Group](https://tamu-pong.github.io).

My research with Dr. [Rob Hetland](https://ocean.tamu.edu/people/profiles/faculty/hetlandrobert.html) focuses on developing an analysis framework called total exchange flow (TEF) to look at mixing processes in the Gulf of Mexico. TEF was developed by MacCready (2011) to look at estuarine circulation and makes use of salinity coordinates (weighted histograms) to describe the dynamics compared to Cartesian coordinates. This is useful because salinity often governs the density structure of estuaries and buoyancy driven flows, revealing insight about the flow's dynamics that Cartesian coordinates do not. We are also investigating how TEF may be used to quantify the net effects of submesoscale (small scale) processes as part of the NSF [SUNRISE](https://sunrise-nsf.github.io/) project.

As an undergraduate, I was an NSF REU scholar here at TAMU and worked on a number of coastal engineering projects at UMaine with Dr. [Kimberly Huguenard](https://civil.umaine.edu/faculty/kimberly-huguenard/). We recently had a paper accepted that discusses the Sensing Storm Surge project, which established a citizen science program to monitor storm surge in several Maine estuaries and rivers. I am a big fan all things related to coastal oceanography and estuarine physics.
