Welcome! I'm a postdoc at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in the Fluid Dynamics and Solid Mechanics Group. I use high-resolution numerical models to study small-scale dynamics in the coastal ocean. I'm part of the [SEAHORÃ‡E](https://seahorce-scidac.github.io/) Project, which seeks to improve the representation of coastal dynamics in the [Energy Exascale Earth System Model](https://e3sm.org/). I work with with Drs. [Mark Petersen](https://mark-petersen.github.io/home/), [Katherine Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherine-smith-6155bbb6/), and [Rob Hetland](https://hetland.github.io/). 

I finished my PhD in the Oceanography Department at Texas A&M University under Dr. Hetland in Summer 2024. My research at TAMU focused on characterizing mixing processes within the estuary-river plume continuum. I spent several years thinking about *numerical mixing*, a type of spurious mixing that arises in ocean models as a consequence of representing the bulk transport of tracers by currents with discrete approximations. We looked at numerical mixing in idealized and realistic numerical simulations of the Texas-Louisiana (TXLA) shelf in the northern Gulf of Mexico. As part of my postdoc, we are currently implementing a new algorithm for quantifying numerical mixing in the Model for Prediction Across Scales-Ocean, the ocean component of E3SM. We are currently seeking two upper-level undergraduate or graduate students for the 2024 summer [LANL parallel computing workshop](https://www.lanl.gov/engage/organizations/xcp/parallel-computing-summer-research-internship).

#### Personal Interests
Outside of work, I enjoy running, hiking, and strength training. Since I moved to New Mexico, I spend most of my free time outdoors. See the [photo gallery](/gallery/) page for some pictures I've accumulated over the years.
